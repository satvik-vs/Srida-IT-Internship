DetectAndDefend Internship Project
Overview
The DetectAndDefend internship, provided by Srida IT, focuses on developing blue teaming skills through hands-on simulations of cyber attacks, log analysis, and detection using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. The project is structured into three phases, each comprising multiple scenarios that simulate real-world attack techniques aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The goal is to enhance skills in threat detection, log collection, and incident reporting using tools like Sysmon, Wazuh, and Windows Event Logs.

Summary
The DetectAndDefend internship by Srida IT has provided hands-on experience in blue teaming. In Phase 1, I completed eight attack scenarios, including Create Local User, configuring Sysmon (SwiftOnSecurity) and Wazuh to detect events like brute force, malware, and privilege abuse. In Phase 2, I completed Lateral Movement, Data Exfiltration, and Persistence, with custom Wazuh rules (100009, 100011, 100013) detecting PsExec, SMB transfers, and scheduled tasks. In Phase 3, I completed Fileless Malware, Lateral Movement via SSH Brute Force, Persistence via Registry Run Keys, Data Exfiltration, and Credential Dumping, using manual scripts, netcat, Hydra, and Mimikatz due to Metasploit issues, with custom rules (100015, 100017, 100019, 100021, 100023) detecting in-memory execution, brute force, registry changes, network exfiltration, and credential dumping.
Challenges included resolving Wazuh alert visibility (ossec.conf, custom_rules.xml), Metasploit unavailability, port 80 closure, and Ubuntu Droplet RDP issues. All findings are documented in the cyber-intern-phase-1 GitHub repository with logs, screenshots, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings, demonstrating my ability to simulate threats, analyze logs, and document findings for a cybersecurity career.
